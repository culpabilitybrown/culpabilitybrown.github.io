In 2005, I took a trip to [Patagonia](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/sets/72157594487347648/), where I saw [Chilean Firebush](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/361949116/in/set-72157594487347648) plants all over the place. Since then I have vaguely looked around for a plant for home, but never really pursued it.

Last summer, however, I ordered some seeds on a whim, put them in the shed and promptly forgot about them. But a couple of weeks ago, while sowing some chilli seeds in a propagator I found the packet and threw in a few of these just to see what would happen. And what do you know, yesterday one of them came up:

This is very exciting! Maybe the rest will follow soon (although I've recently read that they can take up to a year to germinate, so don't hold your breath...)
