April's [Gardener's World](http://www.gardenersworld.com/) has a great feature on patio pots. Something we saw there that we'd not though about before was mixing up herbs with flowers. There were a few herb plants left from last year, so on Saturday morning we took ourselves off to the [garden centre](http://www.northfieldsnursery.co.uk/) to pick up some flowers.

This pot has a bay tree, a rosemary bush, some thyme and a sage plant, mixed in with some Aubrieta 'Chianti' which should spread into a nice mat in between the herbs. We've made up [another one with pansies around a lavender plant](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/16794930739/), and a [handful of others](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/16979820102/).

We also bought some [senettis](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/16773754717/in/photostream/) because they're very hard to resist.

And now it's raining, which should help all of these to settle in nicely...
