Spring is impending, and we've started planning what we're going to do in the garden this year. Thus far we've already received 3 seed catalogues, and our first subscription issue of [BBC Gardener's World Magazine](http://www.gardenersworld.com/), which has got me excited enough to create a Trello board called _Garden_ and start creating tickets.

It's all still coming together, but some things we definitely want to do include:

* Put up a wire along the top of the western side of the kitchen to make a [string trellis](http://bonnieplants.com/2014/05/string-trellis-for-tomatoes-variations/) - last year's tomato plants turned into an [impenetrable jungle](http://twitter.com/pikesley/status/474622855460974593/photo/1) because I never staked them properly
* Grow some heirloom tomatoes - last year's Generic Red Tomatoes were all very well, but [this looks like much more fun](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=heirloom+tomatoes&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=Ia-tVLj4LsTrUoKEgZAN&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1280&bih=705)
* Grow a load of chillis - we have many, many seeds from [last year's crop](https://twitter.com/pikesley/status/463324048647536640/photo/1)
* Grow carrots and beans and stuff in our new [raised beds](http://twitpic.com/e6nd4e) which are currently resting under tarps having been loaded with horse poop at the end of last summer
* Make a pond - we still have all the wood that the tree-surgeons left after [next doors tree came down](https://twitter.com/pikesley/status/481929956902334465/photo/1) so we'll dig a shallow hole and build up the sides with logs
* Have a load of barbecues, obviously

Alongside all the usual herbs and flowers and stuff. I feel a trip to [Crews Hill](http://www.crewshill.com/) coming on...
