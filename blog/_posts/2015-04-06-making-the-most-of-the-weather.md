As you probably noticed, the sun came out today! I made the most of the opportunity to take the tarps off the garden furniture, [clear up the mess around by the shed](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/16871815499/in/photostream/), make up some more patio pots (including a fern for the front yard), pot-up some seedlings, and do a load of general maintenance to clear the decks ready for when the next Gardener's World special offers arrive: we're about to take delivery of 18 fuchsia plugs, 12 Cape daisies, and some hanging baskets.

Oh, and the bluebells in the lawn are looking ready to bloom, so I can cut the grass soon...
