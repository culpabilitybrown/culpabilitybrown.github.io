This weekend Spring arrived with a great big sunny smile. I spent some time cleaning and tidying [the patio](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/16752239531/) (those black polythene bags are [potatoes](/blog/2015/02/10/our-potato-kit-is-here/)), and I also got the growhouse out of the shed and reassembled it to make a home for these seedlings:

The big ones at the back are Ildi tomatoes [which I planted 2 months ago](/blog/2015/01/11/first-planting-of-the-year/), then there are some 100s and 1000s tomatoes, cucamelons, a peperoncini and a Bulgarian carrot pepper. I also have a further 9 varieties of tomato (and some tomatillos) in a propagator in the kitchen, a load of which sprouted yesterday. And I've just put in some [electric daisies](http://www.suttons.co.uk/Gardening/Flower+Seeds/All+Flower+Seeds/Electric+Daisies_147045.htm) which somebody gave us. It feels so good to get back in the garden...
