We took a trip to [Crews Hill](http://www.crewshill.com/) yesterday, where I made my first gardening purchase of 2015: a propagator and a small selection of seeds. I planted the following this morning:

* 10 x [100s and 1000s tomatoes](http://tomato-daily.blogspot.co.uk/2009/08/100s-1000s.html)
* 20 x [Ildi tomatoes](http://www.thompson-morgan.com/vegetables/vegetable-seeds/tomato-seeds/tomato-ildi/404TM)
* 10 x [Cucamelons](http://homegrown-revolution.co.uk/savoury-fruit/growing-cucamelons/)

and the whole thing is currently sitting by our south-facing patio doors.

The tomatoes will find their way into hanging baskets or onto the yet-to-be-built western-wall string trellis (or round to my Dad's, or my Mother-in-Law's); I think the cucamelons might also want trellising, but I'm not really sure yet.

On a side note, it's great to get back in the shed :)
