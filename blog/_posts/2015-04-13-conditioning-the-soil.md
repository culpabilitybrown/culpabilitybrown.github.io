This weekend's glorious weather allowed us 2 full days of gardening. Things that happened:

* We stripped out the entire left-hand (west-facing) border (which up until now had contained a few sorry ferns and shrubs, most of which had come with the house) and [dug in 200 litres of manure](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/17110916076/) ready for some crops in a few weeks
* We [cut the grass](https://instagram.com/p/1YKt6WzeXk/) for the first time this year, [mutilating a lawnmower blade in the process](https://instagram.com/p/1YKSsDTeWn/)
* The [potato plants](http://garden.pikesley.org/blog/2015/02/10/our-potato-kit-is-here/) that we planted a few weeks ago [started to show](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/16949093188/in/set-72157649827363868)
* The apple tree [started to blossom](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pikesley/16949317970/in/set-72157649827363868)
* We bought and planted some violas:
